# Capsule-Endoscopy-Multi-classification-via-Gated-Attention-and-Wavelet-Transformations
This repository implements a novel deep learning model for automatic classification of gastrointestinal abnormalities in VCE frames. It integrates Omni-Dimensional Gated Attention and wavelet transformation into a modified ResNet18-based deep encoder-decoder architecture, enabling intricate multi-level feature extraction.

## Results

The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on Datasets provided by Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge and compared against two baseline models, VGG16 and ResNet50. The model demonstrated superior performance across multiple metrics, highlighting its capability to accurately classify gastrointestinal abnormalities in Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) frames.

### Key Metrics of the Proposed Model:

- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: 87.49
- **Balanced Accuracy**: 94.81
- **Accuracy**: 91.19
- **F1 Score**: 91.11
- **Precision**: 91.17
- **Recall**: 91.19
- **Specificity**: 98.44

The table below provides a comparison of the proposed model's performance with the baseline models:

| Model                | AUC   | Balanced Accuracy | Accuracy | F1 Score | Precision | Recall | Specificity |
|----------------------|-------|-------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **VGG16**            | 91.61 |       56.84       |  69.06   |   48.44  |   52.46   |  54.30 |    96.97    |
| **ResNet50**         | 87.10 |         -         |  76.02   |   76.0   |   78.0    |  76.0  |      -      |
| **Proposed Model**   | 87.49 |       94.81       |  91.19   |   91.11  |   91.17   |  91.19 |    98.44    |

The superior results achieved by the proposed model shows its effectiveness in identifying and classifying gastrointestinal abnormalities accurately.
